Step 3: Calculate the tax rate of the shopping cart with multiple items
Given:

An empty shopping cart
And a product, Dove Soap with a unit price of 39.99
And another product, Axe Deo with a unit price of 99.99
And a sales tax rate of 12.5%
When:

The user adds 2 Dove Soaps to the shopping cart
And then adds 2 Axe Deos to the shopping cart
Then:

The shopping cart should contain 2 Dove Soaps each with a unit price of 39.99
And the shopping cart should contain 2 Axe Deos each with a unit price of 99.99
And the total sales tax amount for the shopping cart should equal 35.00
And the shopping cartâ€™s total price should equal 314.96
